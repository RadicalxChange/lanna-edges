## Joining the community

- To join the community, you must (i) be attending Edge City Lanna, and (ii) deposit $20 USD or equivalent with the community “secretary”. You’ll then get onboarded as a community “member” and receive 100∈.

## The Community "Pool"

- All community members' $20 deposits are put in a community pool. Any member of the community may ask the secretary to return their initial deposit at any time, which will result in the termination of their membership status.
- In fact, any member of the community may ask the secretary to take out up to 5x their initial deposit--however, this is strongly discouraged. If someone takes out more than they put in, that person's membership status will be terminated and the community will be notified.
- The purpose of the Community Pool is to establish a condition of "unsecured trust". It is a symbol of each community member's agreement to participate in good faith.

## Sending ∈dges & “Exit Taxes”

- Members may send ∈dges to members or nonmembers (i.e., anyone with an email address). Non-members who hold ∈dges may only send them to members.
- Every time you send ∈dges, you must note the purpose of the ∈dges payment.
- ∈dges payments are untaxed when they are:
  - To members; AND in exchange for:
    - Personal services,
    - Perishable goods,
    - Work on [listed ∈dges / Edge City Lanna projects](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/EdgesProjectList).
- ∈dges payments are “exit taxed” when they are:
  - To non-members; OR in exchange for:
    - Non-perishable goods,
    - Work on unlisted private / personally-owned projects.
- Exit taxes are 100% and are payable in ∈dges.

## Definitions

- **Personal Services:** Ethereal services that don’t add value to a durable asset.
- **Perishable Goods:** Items intended for immediate consumption.
- **Listed Projects:** Projects listed on the community repo, dedicated to the community good and not privately owned.

## Rule & Secretary Changes

- Rules may evolve and change over time.
- The ∈dges secretary runs meetings for voting on rule changes and may put their role up for election.

## Value Creation

- Value Creation is a metric that is displayed on the [Participants](/participants) page to represent who is creating value in the community.
- Value Creation measures how many ∈dges each participant has received, and how many different people have sent them ∈dges.
  - It is calculated by summing all the transactions a participant has received from each sender, taking the square root, and adding up all the results.
    - This means that participants who receive ∈dges from many different senders will score more highly than participants who receive ∈dges from only one sender.
  - Each participants' Value Creation score depreciates by 5% every 24 hours.
    - This means that Value Creation represents who is creating the most value *recently*.
