## Joining the community

- To join the community, you must (i) have an Edge City Lanna Zupass ticket, (ii) come to an ∈dges meeting, and (iii) deposit $20 USD with the community “secretary”. You’ll then get onboarded as a community “member” and receive 100∈.

## Sending ∈dges & “Exit Taxes”

- Members may send ∈dges to members or nonmembers (i.e., anyone with an email address). Non-members who hold ∈dges may only send them to members.
- Every time you send ∈dges, you must note the purpose of the ∈dges payment.
- ∈dges payments are untaxed when they are:
  - To members; AND in exchange for:
    - Personal services,
    - Perishable goods,
    - Work on [listed ∈dges / Edge City Lanna projects](https://github.com/RadicalxChange/EdgesProjectList).
- ∈dges payments are “exit taxed” when they are:
  - To non-members; OR in exchange for:
    - Non-perishable goods,
    - Work on unlisted private / personally-owned projects.
- Exit taxes are 100% and are payable in ∈dges.
