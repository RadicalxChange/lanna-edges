## Joining the community

- To join the community, you must (i) have an Edge City Lanna Zupass ticket, (ii) deposit $20 USD or equivalent with the community “secretary”. You’ll then get onboarded as a community “member” and receive 100∈.

## The Community "Pool"

- All community members $20 deposits are put in a community pool. Any member of the community may ask the secretary to return their initial deposit at any time, which will result in the termination of their membership status.
- In fact, any member of the community may ask the secretary to take out up to 5x their initial deposit--however, this is strongly discouraged. If someone takes out more than they put in, that person's membership status will be terminated and the community will be notified.
- The purpose of the Community Pool is to establish a condition of "unsecured trust". It is a symbol of each community member's agreement to participate in good faith.

## Sending ∈dges & “Exit Taxes”

  - To non-members; OR in exchange for:
    - Non-perishable goods,
    - Work on unlisted private / personally-owned projects.
